## How to use?
Open the website on your mobile or laptop. The all songs tab consists of all the songs in our library that a user can access and play. The search option can be used to search for a particular song and play it. You can even create your own playlist by clicking on the plus sign beside create new playlist and add songs to the playlist. After creating the playlist, click on a song you want and choose add to playlist to add it to the playlist.

## Current Implementations
1. Frontend of the whole project is done using HTML and CSS.
2. A server has been created that hosts the website.
3. Firebase database has been used to store song data and the songs have been stored on firebase's cloud service.

## Future Implementations
1. User Authentication and creation of accouts for differents users.
2. Use other available APIs like spotify's to access song data and show it the user.
3. A backend that stores the user's data so that the user doesn't lose data when he/she closes it.
4. Create a better interface.
5. Create more routes for increasing efficiency of the website.
