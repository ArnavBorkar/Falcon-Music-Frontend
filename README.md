## How to use?
Open the website on your mobile or laptop. The all songs tab consists of all the songs in our library that a user can access and play. The search option can be used to search for a particular song and play it. You can even create your own playlists (upto 6) by clicking on the add button besides create new playlist and add songs to the playlist. After creating the playlist, choose the playlist you want to add the current playing song to and press the plus button besides it.

## Current Implementations
1. Frontend of the whole project is done using HTML and CSS and JS.
2. A server has been created that using Express and NodeJS that hosts the website.
3. Firebase has been used to store song data and the songs have been stored on firebase's storage service.
4. No APIs have been used to create this music player.

## Future Implementations
1. User Authentication and creation of accouts for differents users.
2. Use other available APIs like spotify's to access song data and show it the user.
3. A backend that stores the user's data so that the user doesn't lose data when he/she closes it.
4. Create a better interface.
5. Create more routes for increasing efficiency of the website.
